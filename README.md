Description - Web application to help plan going to events using ticketmaster and google maps api.

User Story - I would like to find a fun event to go to this weekend, but I am not familiar with all the venues in the city to know if an event is worth traveling to. I want to  see events in my city and quickly get directions to the venue to see if the event is worth traveling to.
